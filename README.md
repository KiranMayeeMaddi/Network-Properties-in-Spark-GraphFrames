# Network-Properties-in-Spark-GraphFrames

All scripts require GraphFrames 0.1.0 and Spark 1.6.
================================================================
PREREQUISITE

Run the following commands in any new terminal window before executing a file. This ensures that python 2 is used instead of the default python 3.

export SPARK_HOME=/usr/local/spark-1.6.2-bin-hadoop2.6

export PYSPARK_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2

export PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2

pip install pandas

================================================================

degree.py
This contains the requested degreedist function.
Usage:
$SPARK_HOME/bin/pyspark --packages graphframes:graphframes:0.1.0-spark1.6 degree.py [filename [large]]

Example:

$SPARK_HOME/bin/pyspark --packages graphframes:graphframes:0.1.0-spark1.6 degree.py ./stanford_graphs/amazon.graph.large large

$SPARK_HOME/bin/pyspark --packages graphframes:graphframes:0.1.0-spark1.6 degree.py ./stanford_graphs/amazon.graph.small

Notes:
	degreedist takes a single argument, a GraphFrame where we want to
	calculate the degree distribution. It returns a DataFrame with two
	columns, 'degree' and 'count'. For each degree, the count of nodes
	with that degree is provided.
	
	degreedist relies on the included function simple(g) which generates
	a simple graph (with bidirectional edges) from the provided
	GraphFrame
	
	If the program is executed without parameters, it will execute
	the degreedist function on four random graphs generated by
	networkx.
	
	The program takes up to two parameters: an input file and the
	optional parameter "large". An input file is expected to have two
	node names on each row -- a source node and a destination node --
	separated by a delimited. If "large" is given, it assumes that
	the input file's first line reports the node and edge count, and 
	also assumes that the delimiter is a space. If the second argument
	is absent (or anything other than "large") it's assumed that all
	lines represent edges and that the delimiter is a comma.
	
centrality.py
This program contains the requested closeness function.
Usage:
	$SPARK_HOME/bin/pyspark --packages graphframes:graphframes:0.1.0-spark1.6 centrality.py
Notes:
	closeness takes a single argument, a GraphFrame whose nodes we want
	to calculate the closeness centrality of. The returned DataFrame
	has columns for 'id' and 'closeness', and lists the nodes in order
	of highest centrality to lowest.
	
	When executed, this script will generate the graph given in the
	assignment and calculate its nodes' closeness centrality.
	
articulation.py
This program contains the requested articulations function.
Usage:
	$SPARK_HOME/bin/pyspark --packages graphframes:graphframes:0.1.0-spark1.6 articulation.py [filename]

Example:

$SPARK_HOME/bin/pyspark --packages graphframes:graphframes:0.1.0-spark1.6 articulation.py 9_11_edgelist.txt

Notes:
	articulations takes a GraphFrame as an argument as well as an
	optional argument named "usegraphframe," which defaults to False.
	If True, the articulation code will use GraphFrames to calculate
	connected components, iterating through nodes serially. If False,
	node iteration will take place using Spark's RDD.map() function, and
	connectedness calculations will take place using networkx.
	
	The program takes one argument, a filename containing an edge list.
	The file is assumed to have two node names on each line separated
	by a comma. At execution completion the program will display
	the articulation points of the graph.
	
	The program will run the articulations function on
	the graph twice, once with each approach to articulation
	calculation as described above. It will time each execution to
	demonstrate which execution is faster. For 9_11_edgelist.txt, the
	non-GraphFrames version is faster.
